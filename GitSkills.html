        Git is important as it enables multiple people in a team to work
        together. It is a version control system.
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        To find out what a version control system is, go to the below youtube
        video.<br />

    <h2>Task 3: Practice in playground project : Install VS Code</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Visual Studio Code helps to write code better and easier. Install your
        VS Code here : https://code.visualstudio.com/Download <br />
        Your can also google to find out how to install the VS code on your PC
        but it should be easy to do so.
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        You must have already created a Git repo in the earlier tasks, open the
        same in Visual Studio Code. <br />
        For hint you could see in this video how to open a folder. Keep in mind
        that you have to open the git repo/folder that you already created.
        <br />

    <h2>Task 4: Welcome to your own playground!</h2>
    <hr
      style="height: 2px; border-width: 0; color: gray; background-color: gray"
    />
    <ol>
      <li>
        In this task you will download the playground repository and establish
        it in VSCode with git <br />
        A sample playground git repository is already prepared for you and you
        should be good to go.
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        To use the playground repo, first open Visual Studio Code(VS Code) in
        your PC. <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            On the top you can see a tab called 'Terminal'<br />
            <img src="images/VSCode_Terminal.png" />
          </li>
          <li>
            Now you can see that a window open at the bottom of VS Code. Which
            drive do you currently see? <br />
            For example in the below case our visual studio code opens in E:
            Drive under ParaGeek folder <br />
            <img src="images/VSCode_Terminal2.png" /><br />
            In your case it could be also just C: drive . Its okay! <br />
            If you want to store your playground files under D drive then just
            type 'd:' as shown below. This will make accessing your files easier
            and quicker<br />
            <img src="images/VSCode_MovetoDDrive.png" /><br />

            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            Now in your terminal just type 'git clone
            https://github.com/parageek/PlayGroundRepo.git' and press enter<br />
            <img src="images/VSCode_GitClone.png" /><br />
            If this step is successful, you will get a new folder automatically
            when you open your corresponding drive. <br />
            <img src="images/VSCode_GitCloneSuccess.png" /><br />
            Next go inside the PlaygroundRepo by doing 'cd PlayGroundRepo' and
            check 'git status'.These steps are shown in the figure<br />
            <img src="images/VSCode_GitCloneSuccessinVS.png" /><br />
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Task 5: Learning to push your changes to github in playground repo</h2>
    <hr
      style="height: 2px; border-width: 0; color: gray; background-color: gray"
    />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Here you will now make some changes and push them in git repo.<br />
        You should push your changes before you finish your tasks for the day. It would be good to push everyday once.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the playground repo that you created in your earlier task in VSCode<br />
        <img src="images/VSCode_PlaygroundrepoOpen.png" /><br />
        You will get a pop up window as shown below, just go to your folder and press selectFolder<br />
        <img src="images/VSCode_PlaygroundrepoOpen2.png" /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Now you can see a file index.html in your left window. Double click on it to open the index.html and see the content there <br />
        <img src="images/VSCode_index.png" /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Currently it is showing 'Hello my name is ParaGeek' , you have to change it to Hello my name is xyz and press 'ctrl+s' to save it.<br />
        
      </li>
      <li>
        Now if you see the differences it will show you the changes and your task is to push the changes. See below figure for the steps<br />
        <img src="images/VSCode_Commiting.png" /><br />
        
      </li>
      <li>
        Now you have to commit your changes before pushing. <br />
        <img src="images/VSCode_Commiting2.png" /><br />
        
      </li>
      <li>
        Now your 'git status' should show that you have done 1 commit. Just push your changes.<br />
        <img src="images/VSCode_gitpush.png" /><br />
        
      </li>
      <li>
        Now go to your playground repo(https://github.com/parageek/PlayGroundRepo) and check if your changes appear  .One way to verify this is check if the comments are the same as you had given<br />
        <img src="images/VSCode_CommentCheck.png" /><br />
        If you see the changes then your task is completed! Congratulations!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Task 6: Your last task is to repeat and practice</h2>
    <hr
      style="height: 2px; border-width: 0; color: gray; background-color: gray"
    />
    <ol>
      <li>
          In the last task you changed the content of index.html to Hello my name is xyz. Now you replace to xyz to your name and push your changes.<br />
        Add some more content in index.html as what is your full name or where you come from etc and push your changes <br />
