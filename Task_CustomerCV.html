    <h1>Live Project</h1>
    <p>
      Our customers want to have all thier CVs(also called resume) ported from
      word documents to html.<br />
      However they would like to see a prototype of one of the CVs. <br />
      Your task is to prepare your CV in *.html and beautify it with *.css as a
      demonstration for our customers.<br />
      At the end of your live task you should present the way you performed your
      tasks! <br />
    </p>

            If you want to practice or try out something please use the
            playgroundrepo which was provided earlier.

        </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Your task is successful if you are able to create a html page that looks like this <a href="Task_CustomerCV/index.html"> here</a>

          </li>
          <li>
            Keep your live repository clean i.e., add respective folders or subfolders if you want to avoid several html files or css files in one place.
